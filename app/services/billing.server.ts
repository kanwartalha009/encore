/**
 * Billing state. Since 2026-09-28 Encore uses Shopify App Pricing (managed
 * pricing): plans are defined in the Partner Dashboard and chosen on Shopify's
 * plan page, and app-pricing.server syncs the merchant's plan into
 * `BillingState` from the Partner API. The old Nova-priced
 * `appSubscriptionCreate` flow was removed — Shopify doesn't allow creating
 * charges with the Billing API once App Pricing is on. Choosing / changing a
 * plan still works, on Shopify's page (App Store requirement 1.2.3).
